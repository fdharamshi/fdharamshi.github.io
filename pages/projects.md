[//]: # (- As a prospective master student in Germany, I spent a lot of time searching for international programs and their related articles shared by applicants. I know there's a [DAAD site]&#40;https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/result/?cert=&admReq=&langExamPC=&scholarshipLC=&langExamLC=&scholarshipSC=&langExamSC=&degree%5B%5D=&fos=&langDeAvailable=&langEnAvailable=&lang%5B%5D=&cit%5B%5D=&tyi%5B%5D=&ins%5B%5D=&fee=&bgn%5B%5D=&dat%5B%5D=&prep_subj%5B%5D=&prep_degree%5B%5D=&sort=4&dur=&subjects%5B%5D=&q=&limit=10&offset=&display=list&#41; which is helpful for searching the desired program; however, I don't like the way it displays search results and I think if I can find related articles shared by former applicants at the same time, that would be simply awesome, so I created this site. I want to create a search tool so amazing that it'll be the one you find your desired programs -- I think this it.)
